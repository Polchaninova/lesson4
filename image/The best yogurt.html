        Smooth, creamy, thick ‚Äî Greek yogurt is one of the hottest foods around,
        and its popularity shows no signs of abating. With a pudding-like
        texture and a slightly tart flavor, Greek yogurt also has more protein
        and fewer carbs and fewer sugars than traditional yogurt. This means
        that Greek yogurt can be even better for people with type 2 diabetes,
        says Tami Ross, RD, CDE, a diabetes educator in Lexington, Kentucky. "My
        patients love the consistency of it," Ross explains. "Even the patients
        who are not big on yogurt or milk products overwhelmingly seem to like
        Greek yogurt." Greek yogurt's thick consistency comes from straining it
        to remove liquid whey. This process increases the amount of protein per
        serving and removes some of the carbohydrates, which people with
        diabetes must watch carefully. "For folks with diabetes, the lower carbs
        are a plus," Ross notes. "You can work in the yogurt for a snack without
        having to account for so many carbohydrates." The increased protein can
        also help you feel that you've had a more substantial snack, so you'll
        feel more satisfied and won't be hungry for something else quite so
        quickly. "In terms of promoting satiety and helping people feel full,
        it's great," Ross says. And starting your day with Greek yogurt may even
        help you manage your blood sugar throughout the day. Eating low-GI foods
        for breakfast helps prevent blood-sugar spikes later on, one recent
        study found.
